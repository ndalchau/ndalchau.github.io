We have developed a system that allows us to tune the level of tapasin expression and independently regulate the expression of competing peptides of different off-rates. By quantifying the relative surface expression of peptides presented by MHC I molecules, we show that peptide editing by tapasin can be measured in terms of “tapasin bonus,” which is dependent on both peptide kinetic stability (off-rate) and peptide abundance (peptide supply). Each peptide has therefore an individual tapasin bonus fingerprint. We also show that there is an optimal level of tapasin expression for each peptide in the immunopeptidome, dependent on its off-rate and abundance. This is important, as the level of tapasin expression can vary widely during different stages of the immune response against pathogens or cancer and is often the target for immune escape.","tags":[],"title":"Tapasin-mediated editing of the MHC I immunopeptidome is epitope specific and dependent on peptide off-rate, abundance, and level of tapasin expression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fil J","Dalchau N","Chu D"],"categories":["DNA Computing","Synthetic Biology"],"content":"","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653609600,"objectID":"7782eadcdbaca090f1d74c2af6cdefb7","permalink":"/publication/2022-acs-sb-fil/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-acs-sb-fil/","section":"publication","summary":"Hebbian theory seeks to explain how the neurons in the brain adapt to stimuli to enable learning.

This paper explores how molecular systems can be designed to show such protointelligent behaviors and proposes the first chemical reaction network (CRN) that can exhibit autonomous Hebbian learning across arbitrarily many input channels. The system emulates a spiking neuron, and we demonstrate that it can learn statistical biases of incoming inputs. The basic CRN is a minimal, thermodynamically plausible set of microreversible chemical equations that can be analyzed with respect to their energy requirements. However, to explore how such chemical systems might be engineered de novo, we also propose an extended version based on enzyme-driven compartmentalized reactions. Finally, we show how a purely DNA system, built upon the paradigm of DNA strand displacement, can realize neuronal dynamics.

These sensors, however, have been mainly implemented using reconstituted PURE cell-free protein expression systems that are difficult to source in the Global South due to their high commercial cost and cold-chain shipping requirements. Based on preliminary demonstrations of toehold sensors working on lysates, we describe the fast prototyping of RNA toehold switch-based sensors that can be produced locally and reduce the cost of sensors by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that these in-house cell lysates provide sensor performance comparable to commercial PURE cell-free systems. We further optimize these lysates with a CRISPRi strategy to enhance the stability of linear DNAs by knocking-down genes responsible for linear DNA degradation. This enables the direct use of PCR products for fast screening of new designs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop novel toehold sensors for the plant pathogen Potato Virus Y (PVY), which dramatically reduces the yield of this important staple crop. The local implementation of low-cost cell-free toehold sensors could enable biosensing capacity at the regional level and lead to more decentralized models for global surveillance of infectious disease.","tags":[],"title":"Decentralizing Cell-Free RNA Sensing With the Use of Low-Cost Cell Extracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhang J","Yordanov B","Gaunt A","Wang M","Dai P","Chen Y-J","Zhang K","Fang J","Dalchau N","Li J","Phillips A","Zhang D"],"categories":["DNA Computing"],"content":"","date":1626652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626652800,"objectID":"f2b5dcb30d0d502288b7150f1828922f","permalink":"/publication/2021-nat-comms-zhang/","publishdate":"2021-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-nat-comms-zhang/","section":"publication","summary":"Targeted high-throughput DNA sequencing is a primary approach for genomics and molecular diagnostics, and more recently as a readout for DNA information storage.

However, sometimes it is only possible to measure qualitative changes of a system in response to a controlled condition. In dynamical systems theory, such change points are known as bifurcations and lie on a function of the controlled condition called the bifurcation diagram. In this work, we propose a gradient-based semi-supervised approach for inferring the parameters of differential equations that produce a user-specified bifurcation diagram. The cost function contains a supervised error term that is minimal when the model bifurcations match the specified targets and an unsupervised bifurcation measure which has gradients that push optimisers towards bifurcating parameter regimes. The gradients can be computed without the need to differentiate through the operations of the solver that was used to compute the diagram. We demonstrate parameter inference with minimal models which explore the space of saddle-node and pitchfork diagrams and the genetic toggle switch from synthetic biology.

Plants house rhizobia in specialized root nodules and provide the rhizobia with carbon in return for nitrogen. However, plants usually house multiple rhizobial strains that vary in their fixation ability, so the plant faces an investment dilemma. Plants are known to sanction strains that do not fix nitrogen, but nonfixers are rare in field settings, while intermediate fixers are common. Here, we modeled how plants should respond to an intermediate fixer that was otherwise isogenic and tested model predictions using pea plants. Intermediate fixers were only tolerated when a better strain was not available. In agreement with model predictions, nodules containing the intermediate-fixing strain were large and healthy when the only alternative was a nonfixer, but nodules of the intermediate-fixing strain were small and white when the plant was coinoculated with a more effective strain. The reduction in nodule size was preceded by a lower carbon supply to the nodule even before differences in nodule size could be observed. Sanctioned nodules had reduced rates of nitrogen fixation, and in later developmental stages, sanctioned nodules contained fewer viable bacteria than nonsanctioned nodules. This indicates that legumes can make conditional decisions, most likely by comparing a local nodule-dependent cue of nitrogen output with a global cue, giving them remarkable control over their symbiotic partners.","tags":[],"title":"Conditional sanctioning in a legume-rhizobium mutualism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ho T","Shao A","Lu Z","Savilahti H","Menolascina F","Wang L","Dalchau N","Wang B"],"categories":["Synthetic Biology"],"content":"","date":1618272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618272000,"objectID":"eb09cc22998773561138f55661b2a754","permalink":"/publication/2021-nat-comms-ho/","publishdate":"2021-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-nat-comms-ho/","section":"publication","summary":"Split inteins are powerful tools for seamless ligation of synthetic split proteins.

We develop a modeling framework for bilayer reaction–diffusion systems and relate it to a range of existing models. We derive conditions for diffusion-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium analogous to the classical conditions for a Turing instability in the simplest nontrivial setting where one domain has a standard reaction–diffusion system, and the other permits only diffusion. Due to the transverse coupling between these two regions, standard techniques for computing eigenfunctions of the Laplacian cannot be applied, and so we propose an alternative method to compute the dispersion relation directly. We compare instability conditions with full numerical simulations to demonstrate impacts of the geometry and coupling parameters on patterning, and explore various experimentally relevant asymptotic regimes. In the regime where the first domain is suitably thin, we recover a simple modulation of the standard Turing conditions, and find that often the broad impact of the diffusion-only domain is to reduce the ability of the system to form patterns. We also demonstrate complex impacts of this coupling on pattern formation. For instance, we exhibit non-monotonicity of pattern-forming instabilities with respect to geometric and coupling parameters, and highlight an instability from a nontrivial interaction between kinetics in one domain and diffusion in the other. These results are valuable for informing design choices in applications such as synthetic engineering of Turing patterns, but also for understanding the role of stratified media in modulating pattern-forming processes in developmental biology and beyond.","tags":[],"title":"Turing patterning in stratified domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grant PK","Szép G","Patange O","Halatek J","Coppard V","Csikász-Nagy A","Haseloff J","Locke JCW","Dalchau N","Phillips A"],"categories":["Synthetic Biology","Dynamical Systems","Pattern Formation"],"content":"","date":1597104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597104000,"objectID":"6427ad56d74c81e03b118db3aebd9ec9","permalink":"/publication/2020-nat-comms-grant/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-nat-comms-grant/","section":"publication","summary":"During development, cells gain positional information through the interpretation of dynamic morphogen gradients.

As the size of the CRNs being considered grows, so does the frequency of isomorphisms, by up to a factor N!, where N is the number of species. Accordingly, being able to generate sets of non-isomorphic CRNs within a class can lead to large computational savings when carrying out global searches.

Each T-cell expresses one variant of many possible receptor molecules, which are generated through a partially random process that culminates in approximately 107�possible T-cell receptors. As the peptide sequence bound to an MHC molecule is also highly variable, the optimal strategy of an antigen-presenting cell for displaying peptide-MHC complexes is not obvious. A natural compromise arises between aggressive peptide filtering, displaying a few peptides with high stability MHC binding in high abundance and regularity, and promiscuous peptide binding, which can result in more diverse peptides being presented, but in lower abundance. To study this compromise, we have combined a model of MHC class I peptide filtering with a simple probabilistic description of the interactions between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and cytotoxic Tcells (CTLs). By asking how long it takes, on average, for an APC to encounter a circulating CTL that recognises one of the peptides being presented by its MHC molecules, we found that there often exists an optimal degree of peptide filtering, which minimises this expected time until first encounter. The optimal degree of filtering is often in the range of values that the chaperone molecule tapasin confers on peptide selection, but varies between MHC class I molecules that have different peptide binding properties. Our model-based analysis therefore helps to understand how variations in the antigen presentation profile might be exploited for vaccine design or immunotherapies.","tags":[],"title":"A theory for how the antigen presentation profile influences the timing of T-cell detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiang Y","Dalchau N","Wang B"],"categories":["Synthetic Biology"],"content":"","date":1538697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538697600,"objectID":"503eb2edadef084662027f78c01744da","permalink":"/publication/2018-nat-comp-xiang/","publishdate":"2018-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-nat-comp-xiang/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic biology aims to engineer and redesign biological systems for useful real-world applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing and biotherapy following a typical design-build-test cycle.

In both cases, the relationship between underlying chemistry and emergent biology remains mysterious. To help resolve the mystery, this article asks the question\u0026#58; what kinds of biochemical systems can generate Turing patterns? We find general conditions for Turing pattern inception -- the ability to generate unstable patterns from random noise -- which may lead to the ultimate formation of stable patterns, depending on biochemical non-linearities. We find that a wide variety of systems can generate stable Turing patterns, including several which are currently unknown, such as two-species systems composed of two self-activators, and systems composed of a short-range inhibitor and a long-range activator. We furthermore find that systems which are widely believed to generate stable patterns may in fact only generate unstable patterns, which ultimately converge to spatially-homogeneous concentrations. Our results suggest that a much wider variety of systems than is commonly believed could be responsible for observed patterns in development, or could be good candidates for synthetic patterning networks.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond activator-inhibitor networks: the generalised Turing mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Smith S","Dalchau N"],"categories":["Pattern Formation","Synthetic Biology"],"content":"","date":1520985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520985600,"objectID":"b6f138580dae655d6fa81fa263f7baa0","permalink":"/publication/2018-interface-smith/","publishdate":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-interface-smith/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthesizing a genetic network which generates stable Turing patterns is one of the great challenges of synthetic biology, but a significant obstacle is the disconnect between the mathematical theory and the biological reality.

However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples\u0026#58; the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species.

If so, complexity could provide an advantage counteracting the costs involved in maintaining larger networks. For that purpose, we investigate how noise affects multistable systems, where a small amount of noise could lead to very different outcomes; thus we turn to biochemical switches.

However, the mechanisms of the rapid selection of high affinity peptides by MHC I from amongst thousands of mostly low affinity peptides are not well understood. We developed computational systems models encoding distinct mechanistic hypotheses for two molecules, HLA-B*44\u0026#58;02 (B*4402) and HLA-B*44\u0026#58;05 (B*4405), which differ by a single residue yet lie at opposite ends of the spectrum in their intrinsic ability to select high affinity peptides. We used in vivo biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection. We used molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity and confirmed this experimentally by altering the plasticity of MHC I with a single point mutation, which altered in vivo selector function in a predictable way. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms by which the co-factor tapasin influences MHC I plasticity. We propose that tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and α3 domain of MHC I allosterically, resulting in enhanced peptide selector function.","tags":[],"title":"Selector function of MHC I molecules is determined by protein plasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rudge TJ","Brown JR","Federici F","Dalchau N","Phillips A","Ajioka JW","Haseloff J"],"categories":["Synthetic Biology"],"content":"","date":1444003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444003200,"objectID":"438ee9d70ae259d2b957a220aa89c1c0","permalink":"/publication/2015-acs-sb-rudge/","publishdate":"2015-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-acs-sb-rudge/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate characterization of promoter behavior is essential for the rational design of functional synthetic transcription networks such as logic gates and oscillators. However, transcription rates observed from promoters can vary significantly depending on the growth rate of host cells and the experimental and genetic contexts of the measurement. Furthermore, in vivo measurement methods must accommodate variation in translation, protein folding, and maturation rates of reporter proteins, as well as metabolic load. The external factors affecting transcription activity may be considered to be extrinsic, and the goal of characterization should be to obtain quantitative measures of the intrinsic characteristics of promoters. We have developed a promoter characterization method that is based on a mathematical model for cell growth and reporter gene expression and exploits multiple in vivo measurements to compensate for variation due to extrinsic factors. First, we used optical density and fluorescent reporter gene measurements to account for the effect of differing cell growth rates. Second, we compared the output of reporter genes to that of a control promoter using concurrent dual-channel fluorescence measurements. This allowed us to derive a quantitative promoter characteristic (ρ) that provides a robust measure of the intrinsic properties of a promoter, relative to the control. We imposed different extrinsic factors on growing cells, altering carbon source and adding bacteriostatic agents, and demonstrated that the use of ρ values reduced the fraction of variance due to extrinsic factors from 78% to less than 4%. This is a simple and reliable method to quantitatively describe promoter properties.","tags":[],"title":"Characterization of intrinsic properties of promoters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dalchau N","Murphy N","Petersen R","Yordanov B"],"categories":["Dynamical Systems","DNA Computing","Synthetic Biology"],"content":"","date":1437436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437436800,"objectID":"eb212690c5cfd6fafd5d70a68716d521","permalink":"/publication/2015-dna-dalchau/","publishdate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-dna-dalchau/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider how to generate chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from functional specifications.

Previous theory has concluded that flowering time has evolved over evolutionary time to maximize fitness over a particular season length. We introduce a new model where flowering is cued by a growth-rate rule (peak nitrogen (N)). Flowering is therefore sensitive to physiological parameters and to current environmental conditions, including N availability and the presence of competitors. The model predicts that, when overall conditions are suitable for flowering, plants should never flower after ‘peak N’, the point during development when the whole-plant N uptake rate reaches its maximum. Our model further predicts correlations between flowering time and vegetative growth rates, and that the response to increased N depends heavily on how this extra N is made available. We compare our predictions to observations in the literature. We suggest that annual plants may have evolved to use growth-rate rules as part of the cue for flowering, allowing them to smoothly and optimally adjust their flowering time to a wide range of local conditions.

As a case study, we use our framework to design synthetic cells with predator–prey interactions that, when simulated, produce complex spatio-temporal behaviours such as travelling waves and spatio-temporal chaos.

MHC class I molecules provide a snapshot of the contents of a cell by binding to protein fragments arising from intracellular protein turnover and presenting these fragments at the cell surface. Competing fragments (peptides) are selected for cell-surface presentation on the basis of their ability to form a stable complex with MHC class I, by a process known as peptide optimization. A better understanding of the optimization process is important for our understanding of immunodominance, the predominance of some T lymphocyte specificities over others, which can determine the efficacy of an immune response, the danger of immune evasion, and the success of vaccination strategies. In this paper we present a dynamical systems model of peptide optimization by MHC class I. We incorporate the chaperone molecule tapasin, which has been shown to enhance peptide optimization to different extents for different MHC class I alleles. Using a combination of published and novel experimental data to parameterize the model, we arrive at a relation of peptide filtering, which quantifies peptide optimization as a function of peptide supply and peptide unbinding rates. From this relation, we find that tapasin enhances peptide unbinding to improve peptide optimization without significantly delaying the transit of MHC to the cell surface, and differences in peptide optimization across MHC class I alleles can be explained by allele-specific differences in peptide binding. Importantly, our filtering relation may be used to dynamically predict the cell surface abundance of any number of competing peptides by MHC class I alleles, providing a quantitative basis to investigate viral infection or disease at the cellular level. We exemplify this by simulating optimization of the distribution of peptides derived from Human Immunodeficiency Virus Gag-Pol polyprotein.","tags":[],"title":"A peptide filtering relation quantifies MHC class I peptide optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dalchau N","Baek SJ","Briggs HM","Robertson FC","Dodd AN","Gardner MJ","Stancombe MA","Haydon MJ","Stan GB","Goncalves JM","Webb AAR"],"categories":["Plant Biology"],"content":"","date":1300752000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1300752000,"objectID":"970b034444b0fd6a1ea122a7656ac8c3","permalink":"/publication/2011-pnas-dalchau/","publishdate":"2011-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-pnas-dalchau/","section":"publication","summary":"Circadian clocks are 24-h timing devices that phase cellular responses; coordinate growth, physiology, and metabolism; and anticipate the day–night cycle.

These peptide-MHC complexes are displayed at the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we reveal how MHC I molecules achieve this feat in the face of numerous levels of quality control. Among these is the chaperone tapasin, which governs peptide selection in the endoplasmic reticulum as part of the peptide-loading complex, and we propose key amino acid interactions central to the peptide selection mechanism. We discuss how the aminopeptidase ERAAP fine-tunes the peptide repertoire available to assembling MHC I molecules, before focusing on the journey of MHC I molecules through the secretory pathway, where calreticulin provides additional regulation of MHC I expression. Lastly we discuss how these processes culminate to influence immune responses.","tags":[],"title":"The cell biology of major histocompatibility complex class I assembly: towards a molecular understanding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dalchau N","Hubbard KE","Robertson FC","Hotta CT","Briggs HM","Stan GB","Goncalves JM","Webb AAR"],"categories":["Plant Biology"],"content":"","date":1279584000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1279584000,"objectID":"35d3426d754bee8f2a8ab4e25700ad52","permalink":"/publication/2010-pnas-dalchau/","publishdate":"2010-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-pnas-dalchau/","section":"publication","summary":"Circadian oscillators provide rhythmic temporal cues for a range of biological processes in plants and animals, enabling anticipation of the day\u0026#47;night cycle and enhancing fitness-associated traits. We have used engineering models to understand the control principles of a plant’s response to seasonal variation. We show that the seasonal changes in the timing of circadian outputs require light regulation via feed-forward loops, combining rapid light-signaling pathways with entrained circadian oscillators. Linear time-invariant models of circadian rhythms were computed for 3,503 circadian-regulated genes and for the concentration of cytosolic-free calcium to quantify the magnitude and timing of regulation by circadian oscillators and light-signaling pathways. Bioinformatic and experimental analysis show that rapid light-induced regulation of circadian outputs is associated with seasonal rephasing of the output rhythm. We identify that external coincidence is required for rephasing of multiple output rhythms, and is therefore important in general phase control in addition to specific photoperiod-dependent processes such as flowering and hypocotyl elongation. Our findings uncover a fundamental design principle of circadian regulation, and identify the importance of rapid light-signaling pathways in temporal control.","tags":[],"title":"Correct biological timing in Arabidopsis requires multiple light-signaling pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lewsey MG","Murphy AM","MacLean D","Dalchau N","Westwood JH","Macaulay K","Bennett MH","Moulin M","Hanke DE","Powell G","Smith AG"],"categories":["Plant Biology"],"content":"","date":1275523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1275523200,"objectID":"ce674253165a86c1e1be963b9e55dfc7","permalink":"/publication/2010-mpmi-lewsey/","publishdate":"2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-mpmi-lewsey/","section":"publication","summary":"The Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b counter-defense protein disrupts plant antiviral mechanisms mediated by RNA silencing and salicylic acid (SA). We used microarrays to investigate defensive gene expression in 2b-transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Surprisingly, 2b inhibited expression of few SA-regulated genes and, in some instances, enhanced the effect of SA on certain genes. Strikingly, the 2b protein inhibited changes in the expression of 90% of genes regulated by jasmonic acid (JA). Consistent with this, infection of plants with CMV, but not the 2b gene-deletion mutant CMVΔ2b, strongly inhibited JA-inducible gene expression. JA levels were unaffected by infection with either CMV or CMVΔ2b. Although the CMV–Arabidopsis interaction is a compatible one, SA accumulation, usually considered to be an indicator of plant resistance, was increased in CMV-infected plants but not in CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Thus, the 2b protein inhibits JA signaling at a step downstream of JA biosynthesis but it primes induction of SA biosynthesis by another CMV gene product or by the process of infection itself. Like many plant viruses, CMV is aphid transmitted. JA is important in plant defense against insects. This raises the possibility that disruption of JA-mediated gene expression by the 2b protein may influence CMV transmission by aphids.","tags":[],"title":"Disruption of two defensive signaling pathways by a viral RNA silencing suppressor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hubbard KE","Robertson FC","Dalchau N","Webb AA"],"categories":["Plant Biology"],"content":"","date":1249257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1249257600,"objectID":"f282a42b70df4bc4424d5255c1efd6a1","permalink":"/publication/2009-biosystems-hubbard/","publishdate":"2009-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2009-biosystems-hubbard/","section":"publication","summary":"The circadian clock is a 24 hour timing device that co-ordinates biological activity with day\u0026#47;night cycles.

Mathematical models have been proposed which describe the transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops generating oscillations, though do not incorporate the interactions with cytosolic messengers such as Ca2+ and cADPR, or with metabolites such as sucrose. The aim of this thesis is to use mathematical modelling to investigate how the circadian clock regulates \u0026#91;Ca2+\u0026#93;cyt, how a cADPR-based feedback loop modulates circadian oscillations, and also how the circadian clock perceives changes in the availability of sucrose. Delay linear systems of ordinary differential equations were used to demonstrate how \u0026#91;Ca2+\u0026#93;cyt is co-regulated by two pathways operating on different timescales, the first dependent on the transcription factor CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), and a light\u0026#47;dark-dependent circadian clock-independent pathway. Simulated mutant analysis provided a potential role for the red-light sensing PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA) in the light-dependent pathway and offered predictions for the dynamics of \u0026#91;Ca2+\u0026#93;cyt when system components are removed. A proposed feedback loop between the second messenger cADPR and the circadian clock was investigated in silico using a pairwise parameter perturbation method on mathematical models of the Arabidopsis central oscillator. Experimental observations from transient and persistent manipulations to cADPR synthesis could be explained with time-varying parametric perturbations to mathematical oscillator models representing the effects of cADPR on clock gene expression, supporting the hypothesised cADPR-based feedback loop. Finally, the dependency of circadian oscillations in darkness on exogenous sucrose availability was investigated using the Three Loop model of the circadian clock. Mathematical analyses and experimental validation demonstrated the involvement of GIGANTEA (GI) in the sucrose-sensing by the circadian clock, either by a transcriptional or post-translational mechanism. Further experimental evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that sucrose up-regulates GI transcription. This thesis identifies components of the circadian clock which serve as entry or exit points for cytosolic signalling and metabolic pathways involved in key physiological processes, and demonstrates the use of mathematics to generate non-intuitive hypotheses for subsequent experimental validation in complex biological systems.","tags":[],"title":"Mathematical modelling of circadian signalling in Arabidopsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dodd AN","Gardner MJ","Hotta CT","Hubbard KE","Dalchau N","Love J","Assie J-M","Robertson FC","Jakobsen MK","Goncalves JM","Sanders D","Webb AAR"],"categories":["Plant Biology"],"content":"","date":1197590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1197590400,"objectID":"7ec58c916f1fd11f4190addfe807e6ee","permalink":"/publication/2007-science-dodd/","publishdate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007-science-dodd/","section":"publication","summary":"Transcriptional feedback loops are a feature of circadian clocks in both animals and plants.

The movements of stomata are controlled by an extensive network of signalling pathways responding to diverse stimuli. One of the regulators of stomata is the circadian clock.

The plant circadian clock modulates a wide range of physiological and biochemical events, such as stomatal and organ movements, photosynthesis and induction of flowering. Environmental signals regulate the phase and period of the plant circadian clock, which results in an approximate synchronization of clock outputs with external events. One of the consequences of circadian control is that stimuli of the same strength applied at different times of the day can result in responses of different intensities. This is known as ‘gating’. Gating of a signal may allow plants to better process and react to the wide range and intensities of environmental signals to which they are constantly subjected. Light signalling, stomatal movements and low-temperature responses are examples of signalling pathways that are gated by the circadian clock. In this review, we describe the many levels at which the circadian clock interacts with responses to the environment. We discuss how environmental rhythms of temperature and light intensity entrain the circadian clock, how photoperiodism may be regulated by the relationship between environmental rhythms and the phasing of clock outputs, and how gating modulates the sensitivity of the clock and other responses to environmental and physiological signals. Finally, we describe evidence that the circadian clock can increase plant fitness.","tags":[],"title":"Modulation of environmental responses of plants by circadian clocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":["Plant Biology"],"content":"","date":1125532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1125532800,"objectID":"75a85ffec0c7371391fde801e5f793ca","permalink":"/project/plants/","publishdate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/plants/","section":"project","summary":"My research in plant biology includes circadian clocks and how the decision to flower depends on carbon-nitrogen availability","tags":null,"title":"Plant Biology","type":"project"}]
