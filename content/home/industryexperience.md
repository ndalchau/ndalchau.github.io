In particular, I helped the construction of the first model of the MHC class I antigen presentation mechanism, a central player in the adaptive immune system (Dalchau et al., PLoS Computational Biology 2011). In Synthetic Biology, I constructed and analysed models of synthetic cell populations which had been modified to give rise to Turing patterns (unpublished) or periodic travelling waves (Dalchau et al., J Royal Society Interface 2012)."
