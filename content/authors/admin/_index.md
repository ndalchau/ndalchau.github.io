Hi! I'm Neil. I am the Chief Research Officer at Synteny. Until recently, I was a Principal Scientist and Research Manager at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) and project lead for [Station B](http://aka.ms/stationb). 

I am interested in how to use computational and mathematical techniques to understand and re-design biological systems. I use mathematical modelling to test hypotheses about system function, and work closely with experimental scientists to design experiments and use data to test and parameterise models. 

I have a keen interest in synthetic biology and immunology applications, which are truly beginning to gain traction in industry now. In recent years, my group has demonstrated how to characterize synthetic biological parts from experimental data, which enables models to be built that can predict high-level behaviours, such as emergent pattern formation. More recently, I have been collaborating with Oxford Biomedica (OXB), who manufacture lentiviral vectors for CAR-T therapy and the Astra Zeneca vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. With OXB, we're using modelling and machine learning to predict how manufacturing efficiency depends on protocol choices and cellular gene expression. 

I am more broadly interested in Immunology, and developed some of the first models of antigen presentation by class I molecules of the major histocompability complex (MHC). I've also carried out research in DNA computing, again developing data-constrained models for guiding design choices that optimize or satisfy higher level specifications. 

Methodologically, I am interested in developing and using techniques that improve the design and optimization of biochemical systems. The majority of my work has used ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and stochastic chemical kinetics (essentially continuous-time Markov chains). I have developed techniques for parameter inference and parameter synthesis with dynamical models. I have recently become interested in probabilistic machine learning models and active learning approaches, including Bayesian optimization.
