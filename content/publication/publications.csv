However, sometimes it is only possible to measure qualitative changes of a system in response to a controlled condition. In dynamical systems theory, such change points are known as bifurcations and lie on a function of the controlled condition called the bifurcation diagram. In this work, we propose a gradient-based semi-supervised approach for inferring the parameters of differential equations that produce a user-specified bifurcation diagram. The cost function contains a supervised error term that is minimal when the model bifurcations match the specified targets and an unsupervised bifurcation measure which has gradients that push optimisers towards bifurcating parameter regimes. The gradients can be computed without the need to differentiate through the operations of the solver that was used to compute the diagram. We demonstrate parameter inference with minimal models which explore the space of saddle-node and pitchfork diagrams and the genetic toggle switch from synthetic biology. Furthermore, the cost landscape allows us to organise models in terms of topological and geometric equivalence.",

When combined with programmable toehold switch-based RNA sensors, these systems can be used to detect arbitrary RNAs and freeze-dried for room temperature transport to the point-of-need. These sensors, however, have been mainly implemented using reconstituted PURE cell-free protein expression systems that are difficult to source in the Global South due to their high commercial cost and cold-chain shipping requirements. Based on preliminary demonstrations of toehold sensors working on lysates, we describe the fast prototyping of RNA toehold switch-based sensors that can be produced locally and reduce the cost of sensors by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that these in-house cell lysates provide sensor performance comparable to commercial PURE cell-free systems. We further optimize these lysates with a CRISPRi strategy to enhance the stability of linear DNAs by knocking-down genes responsible for linear DNA degradation. This enables the direct use of PCR products for fast screening of new designs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop novel toehold sensors for the plant pathogen Potato Virus Y (PVY), which dramatically reduces the yield of this important staple crop. The local implementation of low-cost cell-free toehold sensors could enable biosensing capacity at the regional level and lead to more decentralized models for global surveillance of infectious disease.",

Oligonucleotide probes used to enrich gene loci of interest have different hybridization kinetics, resulting in non-uniform coverage that increases sequencing costs and decreases sequencing sensitivities. Here, we present a deep learning model (DLM) for predicting Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) depth from DNA probe sequences. Our DLM includes a bidirectional recurrent neural network that takes as input both DNA nucleotide identities as well as the calculated probability of the nucleotide being unpaired. We apply our DLM to three different NGS panels: a 39,145-plex panel for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), a 2000-plex panel for human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and a 7373-plex panel targeting non-human sequences for DNA information storage. In cross-validation, our DLM predicts sequencing depth to within a factor of 3 with 93% accuracy for the SNP panel, and 99% accuracy for the non-human panel. In independent testing, the DLM predicts the lncRNA panel with 89% accuracy when trained on the SNP panel. The same model is also effective at predicting the measured single-plex kinetic rate constants of DNA hybridization and strand displacement.",

Plants house rhizobia in specialized root nodules and provide the rhizobia with carbon in return for nitrogen. However, plants usually house multiple rhizobial strains that vary in their fixation ability, so the plant faces an investment dilemma. Plants are known to sanction strains that do not fix nitrogen, but nonfixers are rare in field settings, while intermediate fixers are common. Here, we modeled how plants should respond to an intermediate fixer that was otherwise isogenic and tested model predictions using pea plants. Intermediate fixers were only tolerated when a better strain was not available. In agreement with model predictions, nodules containing the intermediate-fixing strain were large and healthy when the only alternative was a nonfixer, but nodules of the intermediate-fixing strain were small and white when the plant was coinoculated with a more effective strain. The reduction in nodule size was preceded by a lower carbon supply to the nodule even before differences in nodule size could be observed. Sanctioned nodules had reduced rates of nitrogen fixation, and in later developmental stages, sanctioned nodules contained fewer viable bacteria than nonsanctioned nodules. This indicates that legumes can make conditional decisions, most likely by comparing a local nodule-dependent cue of nitrogen output with a global cue, giving them remarkable control over their symbiotic partners.",

Yet, their use remains limited because the already intricate split site identification problem is often complicated by the requirement of extein junction sequences. To address this, we augment a mini-Mu transposon-based screening approach and devise the intein-assisted bisection mapping (IBM) method. IBM robustly reveals clusters of split sites on five proteins, converting them into AND or NAND logic gates. We further show that the use of inteins expands functional sequence space for splitting a protein. We also demonstrate the utility of our approach over rational inference of split sites from secondary structure alignment of homologous proteins, and that basal activities of highly active proteins can be mitigated by splitting them. Our work offers a generalizable and systematic route towards creating split protein-intein fusions for synthetic biology.",

We develop a modeling framework for bilayer reaction–diffusion systems and relate it to a range of existing models. We derive conditions for diffusion-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium analogous to the classical conditions for a Turing instability in the simplest nontrivial setting where one domain has a standard reaction–diffusion system, and the other permits only diffusion. Due to the transverse coupling between these two regions, standard techniques for computing eigenfunctions of the Laplacian cannot be applied, and so we propose an alternative method to compute the dispersion relation directly. We compare instability conditions with full numerical simulations to demonstrate impacts of the geometry and coupling parameters on patterning, and explore various experimentally relevant asymptotic regimes. In the regime where the first domain is suitably thin, we recover a simple modulation of the standard Turing conditions, and find that often the broad impact of the diffusion-only domain is to reduce the ability of the system to form patterns. We also demonstrate complex impacts of this coupling on pattern formation. For instance, we exhibit non-monotonicity of pattern-forming instabilities with respect to geometric and coupling parameters, and highlight an instability from a nontrivial interaction between kinetics in one domain and diffusion in the other. These results are valuable for informing design choices in applications such as synthetic engineering of Turing patterns, but also for understanding the role of stratified media in modulating pattern-forming processes in developmental biology and beyond.",

A proposed mechanism for interpreting opposing morphogen gradients is mutual inhibition of downstream transcription factors, but isolating the role of this specific motif within a natural network remains a challenge. Here, we engineer a synthetic morphogen-induced mutual inhibition circuit in E. coli populations and show that mutual inhibition alone is sufficient to produce stable domains of gene expression in response to dynamic morphogen gradients, provided the spatial average of the morphogens falls within the region of bistability at the single cell level. When we add sender devices, the resulting patterning circuit produces theoretically predicted self-organised gene expression domains in response to a single gradient. We develop computational models of our synthetic circuits parameterised to timecourse fluorescence data, providing both a theoretical and experimental framework for engineering morphogen-induced spatial patterning in cell populations.",

Here, we show how stochastic pulsing of gene expression enables spatial patterns to form in a model multicellular system, Bacillus subtilis bacterial biofilms. We use quantitative microscopy and time-lapse imaging to observe pulses in the activity of the general stress response sigma factor σB in individual cells during biofilm development. Both σB and sporulation activity increase in a gradient, peaking at the top of the biofilm, even though σB represses sporulation. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, increasing σB expression shifts the peak of sporulation to the middle of the biofilm. Our results demonstrate how stochastic pulsing of gene expression can play a key role in pattern formation during biofilm development.",
"Spaccasassi C, Yordanov B, Phillips A, Dalchau N",17/09/2019,Fast enumeration of non-isomorphic chemical reaction networks,Computational Methods in Systems Biology (CMSB),conference,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31304-3_12,,cmsb-spaccasassi,"Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) have been applied successfully to model a wide range of phenomena and are commonly used for designing molecular computation circuits. Often, CRNs with specific properties (oscillations, Turing patterns, multistability) are sought, which entails searching an exponentially large space of CRNs for those that satisfy a property. As the size of the CRNs being considered grows, so does the frequency of isomorphisms, by up to a factor N!, where N is the number of species. Accordingly, being able to generate sets of non-isomorphic CRNs within a class can lead to large computational savings when carrying out global searches. Here, we present a bijective encoding of bimolecular CRNs into novel vertex-coloured digraphs called Complex-Species graphs. The problem of enumerating non-isomorphic CRNs can then be tackled by leveraging well-established computational methods from graph theory [20]. In particular, we extend Nauty, the graph isomorphism tool suite by McKay [22]. Our method is highly parallelisable and more efficient than competing approaches, and a software package (genCRN) is freely available for reuse. Non-isomorphs are generated directly by genCRN, alleviating the need to store intermediate results. We provide the first complete count of all 2-species bimolecular CRNs and extend previous known counts for classes of CRNs of special interest, such as mass-conserving and reversible CRNs.",

Our model class is a generalisation of nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) dynamical systems, the statistical workhorse for many experimental sciences. We cast parameter inference as stochastic optimisation of an end-to-end differentiable, block-conditional variational autoencoder. We specify the dynamics of the data-generating process as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) such that both the ODE and its solver are fully differentiable. This model class is highly flexible: the ODE right-hand sides can be a mixture of user-prescribed or ""white-box"" sub-components and neural network or ""black-box"" sub-components. Using stochastic optimisation, our amortised inference algorithm could seamlessly scale up to massive data collection pipelines (common in labs with robotic automation). Finally, our framework supports interpretability with respect to the underlying dynamics, as well as predictive generalization to unseen combinations of group components (also called ""zero-shot"" learning). We empirically validate our method by predicting the dynamic behaviour of bacteria that were genetically engineered to function as biosensors.",

Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate. BIO-PC enables reliable execution of distributed DNA-based molecular programs in biologically relevant environments and opens new directions in DNA computing and minimal cell technology.",

Inspired from computer science and electronics, synthetic gene circuits have been designed to exhibit control over the flow of information in biological systems. Two types are Boolean logic inspired TRUE or FALSE digital logic and graded analog computation. Key principles for gene circuit engineering include modularity, orthogonality, predictability and reliability. Initial circuits in the field were small and hampered by a lack of modular and orthogonal components, however in recent years the library of available parts has increased vastly. New tools for high throughput DNA assembly and characterization have been developed enabling rapid prototyping, systematic in situ characterization, as well as automated design and assembly of circuits. Recently implemented computing paradigms in circuit memory and distributed computing using cell consortia will also be discussed. Finally, we will examine existing challenges in building predictable large-scale circuits including modularity, context dependency and metabolic burden as well as tools and methods used to resolve them. These new trends and techniques have the potential to accelerate design of larger gene circuits and result in an increase in our basic understanding of circuit and host behaviour.",

However, considerably less attention has been given to the inverse problem of synthesizing CRNs with a specified behaviour, which is important for the forward engineering of biological systems. Here, we present a method for generating discrete-state stochastic CRNs from functional specifications, which combines synthesis of reactions using satisfiability modulo theories and parameter optimization using Markov chain Monte Carlo. First, we identify candidate CRNs that have the possibility to produce correct computations for a given finite set of inputs. We then optimize the parameters of each CRN, using a combination of stochastic search techniques applied to the chemical master equation, to improve the probability of correct behaviour and rule out spurious solutions. In addition, we use techniques from continuous-time Markov chain theory to analyse the expected termination time for each CRN. We illustrate our approach by synthesizing CRNs for probabilistically computing majority, maximum and division, producing both known and previously unknown networks, including a novel CRN for probabilistically computing the maximum of two species. In future, synthesis techniques such as these could be used to automate the design of engineered biological circuits and chemical systems.",

They present peptides on the surface of affected cells, for recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Determining which peptides are presented, and in what proportion, has profound implications for developing effective, medical treatments. However, our ability to predict peptide presentation levels is currently limited. Existing prediction algorithms focus primarily on the binding affinity of peptides to MHC-I, and do not predict the relative abundance of individual peptides on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in situ which is a critical parameter for determining the strength and specificity of the ensuing immune response. Here, we develop and experimentally verify a mechanistic model for predicting cell-surface presentation of competing peptides. Our approach explicitly models key steps in the processing of intracellular peptides, incorporating both peptide binding affinity and intracellular peptide abundance. We use the resulting model to predict how the peptide repertoire is modified by interferon-γ, an immune modulator well known to enhance expression of antigen processing and presentation proteins.",

These networks typically contain positive and negative feedback loops, which are responsible for switch-like and oscillatory dynamics, respectively. Many computing systems rely on switches and clocks as computational modules. While the combination of such modules in biological systems leads to a variety of dynamical behaviours, it is also driving development of new computing algorithms. Here we present a historical perspective on computation by biological systems, with a focus on switches and clocks, and discuss parallels between biology and computing. We also outline our vision for the future of biological computing.",

Current mathematical understanding of patterning is typically restricted to systems of two or three chemical species, for which equations are tractable. However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples: the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species. These examples show that our method significantly simplifies the study of pattern formation in large systems where several species can be considered immobile.",

Here, we report a weighted neighbour voting (WNV) prediction algorithm, in which the hybridization rate constant of an unknown sequence is predicted based on similarity reactions with known rate constants. To construct this algorithm we first performed 210 fluorescence kinetics experiments to observe the hybridization kinetics of 100 different DNA target and probe pairs (36 nt sub-sequences of the CYCS and VEGF genes) at temperatures ranging from 28 to 55 °C. Automated feature selection and weighting optimization resulted in a final six-feature WNV model, which can predict hybridization rate constants of new sequences to within a factor of 3 with ∼91% accuracy, based on leave-one-out cross-validation.

HLA alleles are associated with Gag-specific T-cell responses that are protective against progression of the disease. While Pol is the most conserved HIV sequence, its association with immune control is not as strong. To gain a more thorough quantitative understanding of the factors that contribute to immunodominance, we have constructed a model of the recognition of HIV infection by the MHC class I pathway. Our model predicts surface presentation of HIV peptides over time, demonstrates the importance of viral protein kinetics, and provides evidence of the importance of Gag peptides in the long-term control of HIV infection. Furthermore, short-term dynamics are also predicted, with simulation of virion-derived peptides suggesting that efficient processing of Gag can lead to a 50% probability of presentation within 3 hours post-infection, as observed experimentally.

Here, we show that spatial organization can be a similarly powerful design principle for overcoming limitations of speed and modularity in engineered molecular circuits. We create logic gates and signal transmission lines by spatially arranging reactive DNA hairpins on a DNA origami. Signal propagation is demonstrated across transmission lines of different lengths and orientations and logic gates are modularly combined into circuits that establish the universality of our approach. Because reactions preferentially occur between neighbours, identical DNA hairpins can be reused across circuits. Co-localization of circuit elements decreases computation time from hours to minutes compared to circuits with diffusible components. Detailed computational models enable predictive circuit design.

Due to the diversity in T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules together with both the peptides and MHC proteins they bind to, it has been difficult to design vaccines and treatments based on these interactions. Machine learning has made some progress in trying to predict the immunogenicity of peptide sequences in the context of specific MHC class I alleles but, as such approaches cannot integrate temporal information and lack explanatory power, their scope will always be limited. Here, we advocate a mechanistic description of antigen presentation and TCR activation which is explanatory, predictive, and quantitative, drawing on modeling approaches that collectively span several length and time scales, being capable of furnishing reliable biological descriptions that are difficult for experimentalists to provide. It is a form of multiscale systems biology. We propose the use of chemical rate equations to describe the time evolution of the foreign and host proteins to explain how the original proteins end up being presented on the cell surface as peptide fragments, while we invoke molecular dynamics to describe the key binding processes on the molecular level, including those of peptide–MHC complexes with TCRs which lie at the heart of the immune response. On each level, complementary methods based on machine learning are available, and we discuss the relationship between these divergent approaches.

Several computing algorithms have been designed to perform similar all-or-none decisions with high efficiency. We discuss here how the structure and dynamical features of a computational algorithm resemble the behaviour of a large class of biological switches and what makes them work efficiently.

It is possible to understand how molecular counts are related to noise in specific networks, but it is not generally clear how noise relates to network complexity, because different levels of complexity also imply different overall number of molecules. For a fixed function, does increased network complexity reduce noise, beyond the mere increase of overall molecular counts? If so, complexity could provide an advantage counteracting the costs involved in maintaining larger networks. For that purpose, we investigate how noise affects multistable systems, where a small amount of noise could lead to very different outcomes; thus we turn to biochemical switches. Our method for comparing networks of different structure and complexity is to place them in conditions where they produce exactly the same deterministic function. We are then in a good position to compare their noise characteristics relatively to their identical deterministic traces. We show that more complex networks are better at coping with both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noise tends to decrease with complexity and extrinsic noise tends to have less impact. Our findings suggest a new role for increased complexity in biological networks, at parity of function.",

Natural quorum-sensing systems provide components for cell communication, but their use is often constrained by signal crosstalk. We have established new orthogonal systems for cell–cell communication using acyl homoserine lactone signaling systems. Quantitative measurements in contexts of differing receiver protein expression allowed us to separate different types of crosstalk between 3-oxo-C6- and 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactones, cognate receiver proteins, and DNA promoters. Mutating promoter sequences minimized interactions with heterologous receiver proteins. We used experimental data to parameterize a computational model for signal crosstalk and to estimate the effect of receiver protein levels on signal crosstalk. We used this model to predict optimal expression levels for receiver proteins, to create an effective two-channel cell communication device. Establishment of a novel spatial assay allowed measurement of interactions between geometrically constrained cell populations via these diffusible signals. We built relay devices capable of long-range signal propagation mediated by cycles of signal induction, communication and response by discrete cell populations.

We developed computational systems models encoding distinct mechanistic hypotheses for two molecules, HLA-B*44:02 (B*4402) and HLA-B*44:05 (B*4405), which differ by a single residue yet lie at opposite ends of the spectrum in their intrinsic ability to select high affinity peptides. We used in vivo biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection. We used molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity and confirmed this experimentally by altering the plasticity of MHC I with a single point mutation, which altered in vivo selector function in a predictable way. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms by which the co-factor tapasin influences MHC I plasticity. We propose that tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and α3 domain of MHC I allosterically, resulting in enhanced peptide selector function.",

However, transcription rates observed from promoters can vary significantly depending on the growth rate of host cells and the experimental and genetic contexts of the measurement. Furthermore, in vivo measurement methods must accommodate variation in translation, protein folding, and maturation rates of reporter proteins, as well as metabolic load. The external factors affecting transcription activity may be considered to be extrinsic, and the goal of characterization should be to obtain quantitative measures of the intrinsic characteristics of promoters. We have developed a promoter characterization method that is based on a mathematical model for cell growth and reporter gene expression and exploits multiple in vivo measurements to compensate for variation due to extrinsic factors. First, we used optical density and fluorescent reporter gene measurements to account for the effect of differing cell growth rates. Second, we compared the output of reporter genes to that of a control promoter using concurrent dual-channel fluorescence measurements. This allowed us to derive a quantitative promoter characteristic (ρ) that provides a robust measure of the intrinsic properties of a promoter, relative to the control. We imposed different extrinsic factors on growing cells, altering carbon source and adding bacteriostatic agents, and demonstrated that the use of ρ values reduced the fraction of variance due to extrinsic factors from 78% to less than 4%. This is a simple and reliable method to quantitatively describe promoter properties.",

We then optimise the reaction rates of each CRN using a combination of stochastic search techniques applied to the chemical master equation, simultaneously improving the probability of correct behaviour and ruling out spurious solutions. In addition, we use techniques from continuous time Markov chain theory to study the expected termination time for each CRN.

However, limitations in the speed and scalability of such devices in a well-mixed setting can significantly affect their performance. In this article, we propose designs for localized circuits involving DNA molecules that are arranged on addressable substrates and interact via hybridization reactions. We propose designs for localized elementary logic circuits, which we compose to produce more complex devices, including a circuit for computing the square root of a four bit number. We develop an efficient method for probabilistic model checking of localized circuits, which we implement within the Visual DSD design tool. We use this method to prove the correctness of our circuits with respect to their functional specifications and to analyze their performance over a broad range of local rate parameters. Specifically, we analyze the extent to which our localized designs can overcome the limitations of well-mixed circuits, with respect to speed and scalability. To provide an estimate of local rate parameters, we propose a biophysical model of localized hybridization. Finally, we use our analysis to identify constraints in the rate parameters that enable localized circuits to retain their advantages in the presence of unintended interferences between strands.",

Previous theory has concluded that flowering time has evolved over evolutionary time to maximize fitness over a particular season length. We introduce a new model where flowering is cued by a growth-rate rule (peak nitrogen (N)). Flowering is therefore sensitive to physiological parameters and to current environmental conditions, including N availability and the presence of competitors. The model predicts that, when overall conditions are suitable for flowering, plants should never flower after ‘peak N’, the point during development when the whole-plant N uptake rate reaches its maximum. Our model further predicts correlations between flowering time and vegetative growth rates, and that the response to increased N depends heavily on how this extra N is made available. We compare our predictions to observations in the literature. We suggest that annual plants may have evolved to use growth-rate rules as part of the cue for flowering, allowing them to smoothly and optimally adjust their flowering time to a wide range of local conditions. If so, there are widespread implications for the study of the molecular biology behind flowering pathways.",

However, the ability to program DNA-only self-organisation beyond the microscopic scale is currently lacking. In this paper we propose a computational method for programming spatial organisation of DNA at the centimetre scale, by means of DNA strand displacement reaction diffusion systems. We use this method to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of an autocatalytic system, a predator-prey oscillator and a two-species consensus network. We find that both autocatalytic and oscillating systems can support travelling waves across centimetre distances, and that consensus in a spatial context results in the spontaneous formation of distinct spatial domains, in which one species is completely eliminated. Together, our results suggest that programmed spatial self-organisation of DNA, through a reaction diffusion mechanism, is achievable with current DNA strand displacement technology.",

The advantages of linear systems are that they are relatively simple, efficient to obtain and simulate, and have been studied in great detail. In spite of inherent nonlinearities in real world applications, linear systems have been successfully used in control theory as a tool to model, analyse and control technological systems. In contrast, although at the molecular level reactions are nonlinear, modelling of key behaviours important to predict new features of a system can in many instances be captured by linear dynamics. Guided by a simple example, this chapter explains step-by-step how to use linear system identification (SId) to obtain causal relationships between different biological species in complex networks. We will cover aspects of model estimation, validation and selection. The corresponding Matlab codes will also be introduced. The chapter ends with illustrations of practical applications through two case studies, where SId has been used to further our understanding of biological networks.",

Here we report a DNA-based technology for implementing the computational core of such controllers. We use the formalism of chemical reaction networks as a 'programming language' and our DNA architecture can, in principle, implement any behaviour that can be mathematically expressed as such. Unlike logic circuits, our formulation naturally allows complex signal processing of intrinsically analogue biological and chemical inputs. Controller components can be derived from biologically synthesized (plasmid) DNA, which reduces errors associated with chemically synthesized DNA. We implement several building-block reaction types and then combine them into a network that realizes, at the molecular level, an algorithm used in distributed control systems for achieving consensus between multiple agents.",

We also investigated the plasticity of circadian period within the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator. We monitored the circadian oscillator in wild-type and circadian period mutants under light : dark cycles of varying total duration. We also investigated changes in oscillator dynamics during and after the transition from light : dark cycles to free running conditions. Under light : dark cycles, dawn and dusk were anticipated differently when the circadian period was not resonant with the environmental period (‘T cycle’). Entrainment to T cycles differing from the free-running period caused a short-term alteration in oscillator period. The transient plasticity of period was described by existing mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian network. We conclude that a circadian period resonant with the period of the environment is particularly important for anticipation of dawn and the timing of nocturnal events; and there is short-term and transient plasticity of period of the Arabidopsis circadian network.",

Achieving this goal requires well-characterized components, modular implementation strategies, simulation across temporal and spatial scales and automatic compilation of high-level designs to low-level genetic parts that function reliably inside cells. Many of these steps are incomplete or only partially understood, and methods for integrating them within a common design framework have yet to be developed. Here, we address these challenges by developing a prototype framework for designing synthetic cells with prescribed population dynamics. We extend the genetic engineering of cells (GEC) language, originally developed for programming intracellular dynamics, with cell population factors such as cell growth, division and dormancy, together with spatio-temporal simulation methods. As a case study, we use our framework to design synthetic cells with predator–prey interactions that, when simulated, produce complex spatio-temporal behaviours such as travelling waves and spatio-temporal chaos. An analysis of our design reveals that environmental factors such as density-dependent dormancy and reduced extracellular space destabilize the population dynamics and increase the range of genetic variants for which complex spatio-temporal behaviours are possible. Our findings highlight the importance of considering such factors during the design process. We then use our analysis of population dynamics to inform the selection of genetic parts, which could be used to obtain the desired spatio-temporal behaviours. By identifying, integrating and automating key stages of the design process, we provide a computational framework for designing synthetic systems, which could be tested in future laboratory studies.",

In situations where mechanistic models are not appropriate, I describe how linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, a type of black-box model, can offer quantitative descriptions of biological systems that provide a systems-level understanding without detailed descriptions of the underlying mechanism. A comparison of the two approaches is provided to exemplify when LTI systems modelling might offer advantages for interpreting biological measurements.

MHC class I molecules provide a snapshot of the contents of a cell by binding to protein fragments arising from intracellular protein turnover and presenting these fragments at the cell surface. Competing fragments (peptides) are selected for cell-surface presentation on the basis of their ability to form a stable complex with MHC class I, by a process known as peptide optimization. A better understanding of the optimization process is important for our understanding of immunodominance, the predominance of some T lymphocyte specificities over others, which can determine the efficacy of an immune response, the danger of immune evasion, and the success of vaccination strategies. In this paper we present a dynamical systems model of peptide optimization by MHC class I. We incorporate the chaperone molecule tapasin, which has been shown to enhance peptide optimization to different extents for different MHC class I alleles. Using a combination of published and novel experimental data to parameterize the model, we arrive at a relation of peptide filtering, which quantifies peptide optimization as a function of peptide supply and peptide unbinding rates. From this relation, we find that tapasin enhances peptide unbinding to improve peptide optimization without significantly delaying the transit of MHC to the cell surface, and differences in peptide optimization across MHC class I alleles can be explained by allele-specific differences in peptide binding. Importantly, our filtering relation may be used to dynamically predict the cell surface abundance of any number of competing peptides by MHC class I alleles, providing a quantitative basis to investigate viral infection or disease at the cellular level. We exemplify this by simulating optimization of the distribution of peptides derived from Human Immunodeficiency Virus Gag-Pol polyprotein.",

These data suggest that there is a feedback between the molecular components that comprise the circadian oscillator and plant metabolism, with the circadian clock both regulating and being regulated by metabolism. We used also simulations within a three-loop mathematical model of the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator to identify components of the circadian clock sensitive to sucrose. The mathematical studies identified GIGANTEA (GI) as being associated with sucrose sensing. Experimental validation of this prediction demonstrated that GI is required for the full response of the circadian clock to sucrose.

Linear time-invariant models of circadian rhythms were computed for 3,503 circadian-regulated genes and for the concentration of cytosolic-free calcium to quantify the magnitude and timing of regulation by circadian oscillators and light-signaling pathways. Bioinformatic and experimental analysis show that rapid light-induced regulation of circadian outputs is associated with seasonal rephasing of the output rhythm. We identify that external coincidence is required for rephasing of multiple output rhythms, and is therefore important in general phase control in addition to specific photoperiod-dependent processes such as flowering and hypocotyl elongation. Our findings uncover a fundamental design principle of circadian regulation, and identify the importance of rapid light-signaling pathways in temporal control.",

We used microarrays to investigate defensive gene expression in 2b-transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Surprisingly, 2b inhibited expression of few SA-regulated genes and, in some instances, enhanced the effect of SA on certain genes. Strikingly, the 2b protein inhibited changes in the expression of 90% of genes regulated by jasmonic acid (JA). Consistent with this, infection of plants with CMV, but not the 2b gene-deletion mutant CMVΔ2b, strongly inhibited JA-inducible gene expression. JA levels were unaffected by infection with either CMV or CMVΔ2b. Although the CMV–Arabidopsis interaction is a compatible one, SA accumulation, usually considered to be an indicator of plant resistance, was increased in CMV-infected plants but not in CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Thus, the 2b protein inhibits JA signaling at a step downstream of JA biosynthesis but it primes induction of SA biosynthesis by another CMV gene product or by the process of infection itself. Like many plant viruses, CMV is aphid transmitted. JA is important in plant defense against insects. This raises the possibility that disruption of JA-mediated gene expression by the 2b protein may influence CMV transmission by aphids.",

The plant circadian clock modulates a wide range of physiological and biochemical events, such as stomatal and organ movements, photosynthesis and induction of flowering. Environmental signals regulate the phase and period of the plant circadian clock, which results in an approximate synchronization of clock outputs with external events. One of the consequences of circadian control is that stimuli of the same strength applied at different times of the day can result in responses of different intensities. This is known as ‘gating’. Gating of a signal may allow plants to better process and react to the wide range and intensities of environmental signals to which they are constantly subjected. Light signalling, stomatal movements and low-temperature responses are examples of signalling pathways that are gated by the circadian clock. In this review, we describe the many levels at which the circadian clock interacts with responses to the environment. We discuss how environmental rhythms of temperature and light intensity entrain the circadian clock, how photoperiodism may be regulated by the relationship between environmental rhythms and the phasing of clock outputs, and how gating modulates the sensitivity of the clock and other responses to environmental and physiological signals.

Here we present a method for characterizing the dynamic behavior of synthetic gene circuits, using parameter inference of dynamical system models applied to time-series measurements of cell cultures growing in microtiter plates. We demonstrate that the behaviors of simple devices can be characterized dynamically and used to predict the behaviors of more complex circuits.

Meanwhile, synthetic biologists have designed Turing systems for implementation in cell colonies, but none have yet led to visible patterns in the laboratory. In both cases, the relationship between underlying chemistry and emergent biology remains mysterious. To help resolve the mystery, this article asks the question: what kinds of biochemical systems can generate Turing patterns? We find general conditions for Turing pattern inception -- the ability to generate unstable patterns from random noise -- which may lead to the ultimate formation of stable patterns, depending on biochemical non-linearities. We find that a wide variety of systems can generate stable Turing patterns, including several which are currently unknown, such as two-species systems composed of two self-activators, and systems composed of a short-range inhibitor and a long-range activator. We furthermore find that systems which are widely believed to generate stable patterns may in fact only generate unstable patterns, which ultimately converge to spatially-homogeneous concentrations. Our results suggest that a much wider variety of systems than is commonly believed could be responsible for observed patterns in development, or could be good candidates for synthetic patterning networks.",

Each T-cell expresses one variant of many possible receptor molecules, which are generated through a partially random process that culminates in approximately 107�possible T-cell receptors. As the peptide sequence bound to an MHC molecule is also highly variable, the optimal strategy of an antigen-presenting cell for displaying peptide-MHC complexes is not obvious. A natural compromise arises between aggressive peptide filtering, displaying a few peptides with high stability MHC binding in high abundance and regularity, and promiscuous peptide binding, which can result in more diverse peptides being presented, but in lower abundance. To study this compromise, we have combined a model of MHC class I peptide filtering with a simple probabilistic description of the interactions between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and cytotoxic Tcells (CTLs). By asking how long it takes, on average, for an APC to encounter a circulating CTL that recognises one of the peptides being presented by its MHC molecules, we found that there often exists an optimal degree of peptide filtering, which minimises this expected time until first encounter. The optimal degree of filtering is often in the range of values that the chaperone molecule tapasin confers on peptide selection, but varies between MHC class I molecules that have different peptide binding properties. Our model-based analysis therefore helps to understand how variations in the antigen presentation profile might be exploited for vaccine design or immunotherapies.",
"Csikász-Nagy A, Dalchau N",08/09/2014,What makes a biological clock efficient?,Microsoft Research Cambridge,report,MSR-TR-2014-104,,,cardelli-fest-csikasz-nagy,Biological clocks regulate the proper periodicity of several processes at the cellular and organismal level. The cell cycle and circadian rhythm are the best characterized among these but several other biological clocks function in cells at widely variable periodicity. The underlying molecular networks are controlled by delayed negative feedbacks, but the role of positive feedbacks and substrate-depletion has been also proposed to play crucial roles in the regulation of these processes. Here we will investigate which features of biological clocks might be important for their efficient timekeeping.

Circadian systems across the kingdoms of life,Biochemist,none,12-15.,,,biochemist-dalchau,"The ability to anticipate the day-night cycle and direct physiology accordingly has proven to be a general phenomenon across all kingdoms of life. Considerable fitness benefits are conferred by an internal 24-hour clock, which is known as a circadian clock. Extensive multi-disciplinary studies in a range of model organisms have elucidated many of the components involved in generating and sustaining daily rhythms. When comparing the circadian systems across the kingdoms, it is fascinating to observe the commonalities and differences in their molecular architecture, and the many adaptations which have evolved to deal with organism-specific requirements of biological timing.",
Dalchau N,01/12/2008,Mathematical modelling of circadian signalling in Arabidopsis,Department of Plant Sciences,thesis,,,,thesis-dalchau,"The circadian signalling network in Arabidopsis thaliana generates oscillations with negative feedback loops of transcription factor binding, and regulates many developmental and physiological processes. Mathematical models have been proposed which describe the transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops generating oscillations, though do not incorporate the interactions with cytosolic messengers such as Ca2+ and cADPR, or with metabolites such as sucrose. The aim of this thesis is to use mathematical modelling to investigate how the circadian clock regulates [Ca2+]cyt, how a cADPR-based feedback loop modulates circadian oscillations, and also how the circadian clock perceives changes in the availability of sucrose. Delay linear systems of ordinary differential equations were used to demonstrate how [Ca2+]cyt is co-regulated by two pathways operating on different timescales, the first dependent on the transcription factor CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), and a light/dark-dependent circadian clock-independent pathway. Simulated mutant analysis provided a potential role for the red-light sensing PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA) in the light-dependent pathway and offered predictions for the dynamics of [Ca2+]cyt when system components are removed. A proposed feedback loop between the second messenger cADPR and the circadian clock was investigated in silico using a pairwise parameter perturbation method on mathematical models of the Arabidopsis central oscillator. Experimental observations from transient and persistent manipulations to cADPR synthesis could be explained with time-varying parametric perturbations to mathematical oscillator models representing the effects of cADPR on clock gene expression, supporting the hypothesised cADPR-based feedback loop. Finally, the dependency of circadian oscillations in darkness on exogenous sucrose availability was investigated using the Three Loop model of the circadian clock. Mathematical analyses and experimental validation demonstrated the involvement of GIGANTEA (GI) in the sucrose-sensing by the circadian clock, either by a transcriptional or post-translational mechanism. Further experimental evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that sucrose up-regulates GI transcription. This thesis identifies components of the circadian clock which serve as entry or exit points for cytosolic signalling and metabolic pathways involved in key physiological processes, and demonstrates the use of mathematics to generate non-intuitive hypotheses for subsequent experimental validation in complex biological systems.",
