abstract: Synthesizing a genetic network which generates stable Turing patterns is one of the great challenges of synthetic biology, but a significant obstacle is the disconnect between the mathematical theory and the biological reality. Current mathematical understanding of patterning is typically restricted to systems of two or three chemical species, for which equations are tractable. However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples&#58; the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species. These examples show that our method significantly simplifies the study of pattern formation in large systems where several species can be considered immobile.
